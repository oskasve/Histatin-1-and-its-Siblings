PREAMBLE

AMBER99SB-ILDN with TIP4P-D was used for the simulations

Parameters from http://amber.manchester.ac.uk was used to integrate phosphoserine residue

Integration was achieved by:
Adding all atoms, bonds and impropers with charge in the .rtp file for amino acids
Adding all the new parameters with proper units
Adding the new S1P residue to the aminoacids.hdb file in order to allow the use of -ignh
Adding the tip4p-d.itp file and matching atomtypes with the forcefield
Adding the tip4p-d force parameters to the ffnonbonded file

Inital straight chain was made in Avogadro

A phosphate group was built manually and the structure was optimized

All atomtypes were manually matched to the forcefield and oriented so pdb2gmx would accept the .pdb file

SETUP

gmx pdb2gmx -f Hist-1_PO3H.pdb -ignh -his -o Hist-1_pH7_PO3H.gro

Histidines are singly protonated on the NE2 position

gmx editconf -f Hist-1_pH7_PO3H.gro -d 1.0 -bt dodecahedron -o Hist-1_box.gro

gmx solvate -cp Hist-1_box.gro -cs tip4p.gro -p topol.top -o Hist-1_box_solv.gro

gmx grompp -f ions.mdp -c Hist-1_box_solv.gro -p topol.top -o ions.tpr

gmx genion -s ions.tpr -o Hist-1_box_solv_ions.gro -p topol.top -pname NA -nname CL -neutral -conc 0.150
